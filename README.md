# My Networking Projects Portfolio

Hi Everyone! 👋  
I’m excited to share some projects I built during my **CSE150: Computer Networks** class. These projects gave me a chance to dive into network communication, security, and application-level protocols, and I had a lot of fun experimenting with them.  

## Projects

### 1. University Firewall 🛡️🔒
This was my attempt at building a firewall that could monitor and control network traffic within a simulated university network. I enjoyed figuring out how to inspect packets and create rules that actually work.  

**What I implemented:**
- Packet inspection
- Rule-based traffic filtering
- Logging of allowed and blocked connections  

It was super rewarding to see the firewall catch “malicious” traffic in my tests. I felt like I got a feel of what it's like to be a network security engineer!  

### 2. TCP Chat System 👩‍💻 - 🛜 - 👨‍💻
I also built a simple chat system using TCP sockets. I wanted to see how multiple clients could connect to a server and send messages in real time.  

**Features I focused on:**
- Multi-client support
- Real-time messaging
- Basic user management  

It was amazing to see messages flow seamlessly between clients, and it really helped me understand how TCP works under the hood.
