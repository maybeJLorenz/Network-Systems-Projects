# My Networking Projects Portfolio

Hi Everyone! 👋  
I’m excited to share some projects I built during my **CSE150: Computer Networks** class. These projects gave me a chance to dive into network communication, security, and application-level protocols, and I had a lot of fun experimenting with them.  

## Projects

### 1. University Firewall
This was my attempt at building a firewall that could monitor and control network traffic within a university network. I enjoyed figuring out how to inspect packets and create rules that actually work.  

**What I implemented:**
- Packet inspection
- Rule-based traffic filtering
- Logging of allowed and blocked connections  

It was super rewarding to see the firewall catch “malicious” traffic in my tests—I felt like a real network security engineer!  

### 2. TCP Chat System
I also built a simple chat system using TCP sockets. I wanted to see how multiple clients could connect to a server and send messages in real time.  

**Features I focused on:**
- Multi-client support
- Real-time messaging
- Basic user management  

It was amazing to see messages flow seamlessly between clients, and it really helped me understand how TCP works under the hood.  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (for the firewall project)  
- Python or C++ environment (depending on which version of the chat system you run)  

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NEW-REPO-NAME.git
